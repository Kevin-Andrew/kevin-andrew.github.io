Safeguard API Explorer

I decided to go with a "Most Recently Used" menu, instead of tabs because often the method names are very long and tabs wouldn't be as effective. Also, we would end up with "tabs within tabs", with each method tab having its own Request, Response, and Documentation tab, which can lead to a cumbersome UI experience.
