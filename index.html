   <h1>Hello World</h1>
   <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
   <p>If I wanted to try hosting a Blazor Web Assembly application on GitHub pages,
   I wonder if it would be allowed? It is technically not a server-side language.
   However, I wonder if there would be a MIME type restriction. See the documentation
   <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#mime-types-on-github-pages">here</a>.</p>
