   <h1>Hello World</h1>
   <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
   <p>
      If I wanted to try hosting a Blazor Web Assembly application on GitHub pages,
      I wonder if it would be allowed? It is technically not a server-side language.
      However, I wonder if there would be a MIME type restriction. See the documentation
      <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#mime-types-on-github-pages">here</a>.
   </p>
   <p>Thanks to the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44874349">StackOverflow post</a>, as usual,
   for the actual answer as to how to get themes to work with your HTML pages on GitHub pages. Nowhere in the
   GitHub pages documentation did I find a mention of the fact that your HTML pages couldn't include the
   &lt;html> tag.</p>
